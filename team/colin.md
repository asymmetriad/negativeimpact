    Hi, I'm Colin, a Computer Science student at the University of Massachussetts Amherst. \
I have used Javascript in the context of computer graphics before, as well as some Java, Python, Lisp, C, and C++. \
I also use Emacs and the LaTeX typesetting system, and waste my CPU cycles compiling the Linux kernel. \
Web development is new to me, so I will try my best to make sense of it. \
Lets code some stuff!
